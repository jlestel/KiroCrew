"""After N sessions open and close, what is still on this machine? Zero.

This module is the leak gate. It boots ONE real gateway on a throwaway data
home, drives ``SESSION_COUNT`` dashboard chat sessions through a full turn each,
closes every one of them, and then asks the kernel and the product's own
registry what survived. Four populations must be empty:

* live pids inside the instance's own agent slice,
* managed MCP stub processes,
* registry entries (nothing tracked, alive or dead),
* crew-log write handles held by the gateway process.

Why a real gateway subprocess and not the in-process boot in
``test/integration/``: two of the four assertions are about the gateway PROCESS
itself. ``/proc/<gateway pid>/fd`` is only the gateway's fd table when the
gateway is its own process, and an agent slice is only this instance's when the
instance has its own data home. Booted in-process, the "gateway pid" is pytest,
whose fd table and cgroup belong to the test runner.

The measurement is a RECONCILIATION, never a single count -- see
``e2e.process_inventory``. A leak shows up as a live process nothing owns; a
stale registry entry shows up as an owner whose process is gone. The two need
opposite fixes, so they are reported separately.

The live peak is asserted BEFORE the teardown, and that is the load-bearing
part of this file. "Nothing survived" is also what a run produces when nothing
ever started -- a gateway whose turns silently failed, a slice this harness
looked for in the wrong place, a fixture that spawns no agent at all. Without
the peak assertion the whole module is green on an empty machine, which is the
exact false green the gate exists to prevent.

Gating, and why there are two switches
--------------------------------------
* ``KIROCREW_E2E`` lifts the module skip. A bare ``pytest`` run does not pay a
  gateway boot plus five model turns.
* ``KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE`` turns an unmet PRECONDITION from a graceful
  ``pytest.skip`` into a ``pytest.fail``. pytest counts a skip as a pass, so a
  required job could otherwise report green having measured nothing. Shared
  with the other E2E gates rather than spelled per-module; see
  ``docs/ci/e2e-gate.md``.

The hard precondition is a usable ``systemd --user`` scope backend. Without it
the product spawns agents unwrapped, no per-instance slice directory is ever
created, and every population reads empty for want of somewhere to look. That
is reported as unresolved -- never as a pass. No substitute is accepted: the
whole value of this layer is real processes in a real cgroup.
